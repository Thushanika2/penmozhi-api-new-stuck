# Penmozhi Women's Health API

Penmozhi is a Flask REST API for women’s health tracking. It covers authentication, health profiles, cycle logging, symptom tracking, reminders, PCOS status, educational resources, AI support, and a community forum.

This README is written for testing the API in Postman with the same routes and request formats implemented in the backend.

---

## 1. Local setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- MySQL Server
- Postman

### Install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DB_USER=your_user_name
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=penmozhi_db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<unique-random-secret-with-at-least-32-characters>
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_MINUTES=1440
FLASK_DEBUG=True
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<cloud-name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<api-key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<api-secret>
```

All three Cloudinary variables are required for admin education-video uploads.
On Railway, set them on the API service itself. Startup logs report only whether
each variable is present; secret values are never logged.

### Create the database

```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE penmozhi_db;"
```

### Start the server

```bash
python run.py
```

Base URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## 2. Seed demo data

Run the seeders to create sample users, health data, reminders, education resources, forum content, and AI sessions:

```bash
python run_seeders.py
```

### Demo accounts

| Role | Email               | Password   |
| ---- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| User | `user@penmozhi.com` | `User123!` |

The seeded data also creates:

- a health profile for the demo user
- cycle logs
- symptom logs
- reminders
- educational resources
- a forum post and comment
- AI assistant session data

---

## 3. Postman setup

Create a new Postman collection called `Penmozhi API`.

Create a new environment called `Penmozhi Local` with these variables:

| Variable       | Value                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| `base_url`     | `http://127.0.0.1:5000` |
| `access_token` | empty                   |

### Important Postman notes

- Use `raw JSON` for request bodies.
- For protected routes, add this header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}
```

- For all examples below, use `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in the URL instead of typing the full host each time.

## 13. Recommended Postman test order

1. Register a user or use a seeded account.
2. Login and save the returned token.
3. View your profile.
4. Update your health profile.
5. Create a cycle entry.
6. Create a symptom entry.
7. Create a reminder.
8. Ask the AI assistant for recommendations.
9. View your PCOS status.
10. Browse education resources.
11. Create a forum post.
12. Add a comment.

---

## 14. Troubleshooting

- `401` or `403` means the token is missing, invalid, or expired.
- `400` usually means the request body or data format is incorrect.
- `404` means the requested resource or id was not found.
- `500` usually indicates a server or database issue.
- Make sure MySQL is running and your `.env` values are correct.
- If the server does not start, verify that dependencies were installed successfully.
- Admin video uploads use signed 6 MB chunks sent directly from the browser to
  Cloudinary. The API only signs the upload and verifies the completed response,
  avoiding Vercel proxy and Gunicorn request timeouts for large files.
- A `502` with `education.cloudinary_auth_failed` means the Cloudinary values on
  Railway are present but invalid or do not belong to the same Cloudinary account.
- A `413` with `validation.video_too_large` means the file or Cloudinary account
  upload limit is below the requested video size (the app maximum is 200 MB).
